# Project Debugging & Setup Log

**Date:** [Insert Date]

## Summary
This log captures the current state and recent actions taken to set up and debug the Decentralized Freelance Marketplace project. Use this as a reference to quickly resume work in the future.

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Terminal Errors (PowerShell)
- Both backend and frontend failed to start due to use of `&&` (not supported in PowerShell).
- Correct approach: Run `cd` and the start command as separate lines.

### 2. Backend Setup
- Fixed duplicate and missing imports in `backend/app/core/config.py`.
- Added missing dependency `sentry-sdk` to `backend/requirements.txt`.
- Installed missing dependency: `email-validator` (via `pip install pydantic[email]`).
- `.env` file is required for backend but is blocked from being created by global ignore. Use `env.example` as a template.
- **Backend server started with:** `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

### 3. Frontend Setup
- `.env` file is required for frontend but is blocked from being created by global ignore. Use `env.example` as a template.
- **Frontend server started with:** `npm run dev`

---

## Outstanding Issues / Next Steps
- Manually create `.env` files for both backend and frontend using their respective `env.example` files.
- If further errors occur, check the logs and resolve missing dependencies or configuration issues.

---

## Quick Reference
- Backend dependencies: `backend/requirements.txt`
- Frontend dependencies: `frontend/package.json`
- Environment variable templates: `backend/env.example`, `frontend/env.example`
- Main backend entry: `backend/app/main.py`
- Main frontend entry: `frontend/pages/index.tsx`
