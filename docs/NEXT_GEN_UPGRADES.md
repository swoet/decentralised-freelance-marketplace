## Step 1: Enhance User Experience

Objectives
- Clean, responsive design using a consistent design system.
- Customizable dashboards for freelancers and clients.

Deliverables
- Design system tokens (colors/spacing/typography) and component library (Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Modals, Tabs, Tables, Charts).
- Pages/Routes: Dashboard (Freelancer, Client), Projects, Bids, Messages, Profile, Settings.
- Dashboard widgets: Active projects, milestones, earnings/spend, tasks, messages, alerts, reputation.

Backend/Frontend Changes
- Frontend (Next.js):
  - Create reusable components under frontend/components/ui/*
  - Add dashboard pages with widget composition and settings (persist via API/user prefs).
- Backend (FastAPI):
  - Add endpoints for user preferences, dashboard layout, and widgets data aggregation.

Acceptance Criteria
- Lighthouse performance > 85 mobile/desktop on primary pages
- All pages responsive (xs–xl)
- Dashboard widgets draggable/arrangeable and persisted per user

---

## Step 2: Implement Advanced Features

AI-Powered Matching
- Data: user skills, experience, past projects, ratings; project requirements, budget, timeline, keywords.
- Approach: Hybrid ranker combining keyword/BM25, semantic embeddings, and rules (budget/time/availability).
- Service: Matching microservice (Python/FastAPI) or integrated module; async jobs to refresh candidate lists.
- Endpoints: POST /api/v1/match/projects/{id}; GET /api/v1/match/recommendations?user_id=; feedback loop endpoint to improve ranking.

Skill Verification
- Methods: Document/KYC (optional), code challenges, portfolio validation, endorsements, badge issuance (on-chain optional).
- Endpoints: POST /api/v1/skills/verify; GET /api/v1/skills/status; Admin review workflow.

Reputation & Feedback
- Model: weighted score = average rating + decay factor + dispute history + on-time delivery + verification badges.
- Tables: reviews, reputation_snapshots; fields for rater, ratee, project_id, ratings, comments, timestamps.
- Endpoints: POST /api/v1/reviews; GET /api/v1/reputation/{user_id}; aggregation cron.

Acceptance Criteria
- Matching API returns top-N relevant freelancers with explainability metadata.
- Verification pipeline supports at least two methods and admin approval.
- Reputation visible on profiles and affects search/sort.

---

## Step 3: Blockchain and Smart Contracts

Multi-Chain Support
- Target chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Base (configurable via env).
- Use WalletConnect/web3modal on frontend; web3.py/ethers.js per environment.

Smart Contracts
- Escrow improvements: milestone-based releases, arbitration, dispute resolution.
- Factory pattern for project escrows; events for off-chain indexing.
- Security: reentrancy guards, pausability, upgradeability via UUPS if needed.

Native Token
- ERC20 for rewards/governance/discounts; emissions schedule, staking for fee discounts, DAO voting snapshot.

Acceptance Criteria
- Deploy and interact with escrow contracts on two networks.
- Token deploy on testnet; integration with rewards workflow.

---

## Step 4: Security and Privacy

2FA
- TOTP-based (RFC 6238) with backup codes; optional WebAuthn in v2.
- Endpoints: enable/verify/disable 2FA, recovery flow.

Encryption & Secrets
- At-rest: encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., with Fernet/KMS); in-transit: HTTPS/TLS everywhere.
- Secret management: environment variables, vault if available.

Compliance
- Data minimization, consent management, right to erasure/export endpoints, audit logging and retention policy.

Acceptance Criteria
- 2FA flows working end-to-end with backup codes.
- DPA/GDPR checklist satisfied; data export/delete endpoints.

---

## Step 5: Community and Support

Community
- Forums (integrate Discourse/NodeBB) or in-app discussion boards for topics.
- Events: calendar, RSVP, reminders; networking directory.

Support
- 24/7 chatbot (LLM-powered) with escalation to human agents; ticketing integration (Zendesk/Freshdesk).

Acceptance Criteria
- Forum SSO with platform accounts; basic moderation.
- Chatbot handles FAQs; seamless handoff to human agents.

---

## Step 6: Integrations and APIs

Integrations
- Project Management: Trello/Jira/Linear; Payment: Stripe + crypto gateways; Comms: Slack/Discord/Webhooks.

Developer API
- OpenAPI/Swagger for backend; API keys with rate limiting; webhooks for important events (project created, milestone paid).

Acceptance Criteria
- At least one integration live for each category.
- Public API docs published and keys issued per org/user.

---

## Step 7: Sustainability and Social Impact

- Carbon offsetting partner (e.g., KlimaDAO, traditional providers) for chain usage; per-transaction estimation/reporting.
- Fee/tokens allocation to social causes; transparent on-chain treasury with public dashboards.

Acceptance Criteria
- Monthly sustainability report generated automatically.

---

## Step 8: Scalability and Performance

Architecture & Infra
- Containerize services; move from docker-compose to Kubernetes when ready.
- Caching: Redis for sessions, query caching; Queue: Celery/RQ for async jobs.
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK/Opensearch, tracing (OpenTelemetry).
- CDN for static assets.

Performance
- Load testing with k6/Locust; database indexing and query optimization; N+1 detection; connection pooling.

Acceptance Criteria
- k6 tests to 5x current load with SLOs met; dashboards for latency, error rate, throughput.

---

## Step 9: USPs and Differentiation

- Focus on niche verticals (e.g., DeFi security audits, AI agents, healthcare IT); tailor workflows and templates.
- Pilot programs with lighthouse customers; gather feedback cycles bi-weekly.

---

## Data Model Changes (Proposed)

- users: add fields for 2FA, reputation_score, verification_level, preferences (JSONB).
- skills: id, name, category, description.
- user_skills: user_id, skill_id, level, verified, verification_method, updated_at.
- reviews: id, project_id, from_user_id, to_user_id, rating (1–5), text, on_time, quality_score, created_at.
- reputation_snapshots: user_id, score, components (JSON), created_at.
- matches: project_id, candidate_user_id, score, rationale (JSON), created_at.
- dashboard_layouts: user_id, layout (JSON), updated_at.
- audit_logs: id, user_id, action, metadata (JSON), created_at.

---

## API Surface (Proposed)

- Auth/Security: POST /api/v1/2fa/enable | /verify | /disable | /recovery
- Matching: POST /api/v1/match/projects/{id} | GET /api/v1/match/recommendations
- Skills: POST /api/v1/skills/verify | GET /api/v1/skills/status
- Reviews/Reputation: POST /api/v1/reviews | GET /api/v1/reputation/{user_id}
- Dashboard: GET/PUT /api/v1/users/{id}/dashboard
- Privacy: GET /api/v1/users/{id}/export | DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}
- Webhooks: POST /api/v1/webhooks/{topic}

---

## Frontend Work (Proposed)

- Design system: tokens + Tailwind/Chakra/MUI theme; component library.
- Pages: freelancer-dashboard, client-dashboard, settings (2FA), profile (skills, badges), projects, bids, messages.
- Integrations UI: OAuth flows, connection management, webhook management.
- Community UI: forum embed/SSO, events calendar.
- Observability: basic client-side error logging (Sentry) and performance metrics.
